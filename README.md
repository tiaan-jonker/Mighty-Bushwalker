# The Migthy Bush App

We all love the nature and beauty of Aotearoa. One of the best pasttimes that we can do in our country is to explore the native flora and fauna via bushwalks! Our app will allow you to get the best out of Aotearoas bush walks by saving your favourite trails, discovering new ones and levelling up your walking with our in-built progression system. We present to you, "The Mighty Bush!"

Built in one week, by [Clementine](https://github.com/clementine-smart), [Finn](https://github.com/MsFinnJ), [Tiaan](https://github.com/tiaan-jonker), [Jesse](https://github.com/jesse-reeves) and [Tai](https://github.com/atmour-tai-mourie), as final project for [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8Kuktbb0DWX4Q7kk5pH-HMplNUiMBA60xYTWzpVqCMnxMTEKjYY5zl0_waAg0aEALw_wcB). We learned an incredible amount and had loads of fun creating it!

## Note on the app

This application is meant to be downloaded and to function as an iOS or Android mobile application. However, at this stage the entire app is built with React and made to 'simulate' a mobile application. That took some creative thinking. In future the app might be converted and written in React Native. In any case, for some us in this group, the intent is to learn React Native and attempt building a mobile app. 

## Getting Started

Clone and cd to this repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kahikatea-2022/bush-explorer.git

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Credits

The beautiful illustration pictures used throughout the app is attributed to: [Brian Edward Miller](https://dribbble.com/bemocs). However, the registration and login page background was designed by Clementine. 

The icons used in this app is either designed by us in Figma or obtained from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).
